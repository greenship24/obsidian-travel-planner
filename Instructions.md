### Basic formatting syntax
- [Basic formatting syntax - Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax) 

### Using templates
- Make a new note
- Open command palette (swipe down on mobile or Ctrl+P on computer)
- Select "Insert template" and choose the template
- ! Use a tag and the note will move into the right folder
	- ie. # and then dublin (no space) will move the note to the dublin folder
	- also, # and dublin/food will move it to the right folder
	- ^ Basically put the right city and let it do the work for you

### Adding things to do
- Insert the event template (use instructions above)
- Add the tag (usually # cityname) and it will automatically move to the right folder (provided you have configured Auto Note Mover)
- To add a geo coordinate for it so it shows on mapview
	- Navigate to the top part of the template and insert a space after the title name that is in the [ ] brackets (to query for a place)
	- Select the place in the results that matches
	- Select a tag in the dropdown to provide an icon for the mapview
